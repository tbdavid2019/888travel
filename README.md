A single-screen travel app you **host yourself**, for free, on your own
Cloudflare account. It pulls your trips together and (optionally) fills them in
automatically from your **Google Calendar** and **Gmail**, then adds the extras:
a year calendar, a "been there" world map, per-trip weather, currency, plug
type, emergency numbers, and one-tap "add to any calendar."

> **Personal and self-hosted.** Each person runs their *own* copy with their
> *own* data. Nobody logs into anyone else's instance; there is no shared
> server. Everything lives in *your* Cloudflare account, behind *your* password.

## ✨ Key features

**Trips & plans**
- 🧳 **Per-trip plans** — attach flights, hotels, rides and free-text notes to any
  trip; manual plans are never overwritten by a sync.
- ✍️ **Add by hand or let it fill itself in** — type a trip in seconds, or connect
  Google (below) and let bookings flow in on their own.
- 🛟 **Your hand-made plans are sacred** — no automatic sync ever changes or
  deletes a plan you added yourself.

**🌐 Multi-language & Localized (多語系與在地化)**
- 🇹🇼 **繁體中文 & English** — One-tap seamless language toggle in the header navigation and Settings modal, with automatic persistence (`localStorage`).
- ✍️ **Optimized typography** — Beautiful CJK font stack (`PingFang TC`, `Noto Sans TC`, `Microsoft JhengHei`) tuned for crisp readability across mobile and desktop.
- 📆 **Localized date formats & categories** — Flights, hotels, rides, itinerary timeline, and year wrapped stats natively adapted for traditional Chinese travel vocabulary.

**Planning & overview**
- 🗓️ **Calendar overview** — a 3 / 6 / 12-month view of exactly when you're away,
  with every travel day marked.
- 📊 **Days away by year** — see total days travelled per calendar year (Jan 1–Dec 31);
  tap a year for the per-trip breakdown so any number is one tap from "why."
- 🌍 **"Been there" world map** — every country you've set foot in, filled in on a
  world map, each with a **visit count** (even tiny island nations).
- 🛫 **Upcoming / Past / Wishlist** tabs, with a fare-watch wishlist for trips
  you're still dreaming up.

**At-a-glance destination intel** (auto-filled per trip)
- 🌦️ **Weather** for your travel dates (forecast, or the typical climate if far off).
- 💱 **Currency** vs both **€ and $**, live rates.
- 🔌 **Plug type & voltage** so you pack the right adapter.
- 🆘 **Local emergency number**.
- 🖼️ **A real photo** of where you're heading.

**On your phone & yours alone**
- 🔗 **Share a trip** — one tap copies a private read-only link so a travel
  companion sees the live itinerary (hotel door codes included), no login.
- 🎉 **Year wrapped** — flip the share card to your year in review: trips,
  days away, countries, distance — story-ready.
- 📅 **Add to any calendar** — one-tap `.ics` export for Apple / Google / Outlook,
  plus a private **subscribe-by-URL feed** of all trips that stays updated.
- 🩹 **Weekly snapshots** — an automatic full backup every Sunday (4 weeks
  kept, plus one before every destructive action), restored in one tap.
- 📱 **Installs like a native app** — Add to Home Screen on iPhone or Android, opens
  full-screen, works offline (it's a PWA). *(Step-by-step below.)*
- 🔐 **Your own password** — set once, stays signed in for 30 days per device.
- 🗄️ **Backup & import** — export all your trips as JSON, re-import any time.
- 🛡️ **100% your data** — everything lives in *your* Cloudflare account; nobody
  else (not even the repo author) can see your trips.

## Deploy your own (≈5 minutes, free)

### 1. Click the button

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/giovannibrees/travel-roamradar)

This copies the repo into **your** GitHub, creates the Worker in **your**
Cloudflare account, and **auto-creates the KV namespace** it needs. (Free plan
is plenty.) When it finishes you'll get a URL like
`https://travel-roamradar.<you>.workers.dev`.

> **No keys are needed to deploy.** If the form shows any variables screen,
> leave everything as-is and continue — Google and Claude both connect
> **inside the app** afterwards (Settings), never at deploy time.
>
> **"An unknown error occurred" under Project name?** Almost always one of:
> a leftover repo from an earlier attempt with the same name on your GitHub
> (delete it or pick a new project name), the Cloudflare GitHub app not
> having access to the selected Git account (github.com → Settings →
> Applications → Cloudflare Workers & Pages → grant access), or a brand-new
> Cloudflare account that hasn't registered its `workers.dev` subdomain yet
> (Cloudflare dash → Workers & Pages → set your subdomain, then retry).

### 2. Open the app and set your password

Open your new URL. The **first** person to log in sets the email + password —
so do this immediately. (Use any email; it's just your login.)

### 3. Start adding trips

That's all you need — add a trip with dates and everything else (weather,
currency, map, calendar) fills in around it. Want your bookings to import
themselves? Connect Google in the **Automatic import** section below.

### 4. Put it on your phone's home screen

See **"📱 Add it to your home screen"** just below for the per-phone steps.

That's it. 🎉

## 📱 Add it to your home screen

The app is a **PWA** — once it's on your home screen it opens full-screen with
its own icon, no browser bars, and works like a normal app (even offline for the
parts that don't need the network).

### iPhone / iPad (Safari)
1. Open your app URL (e.g. `https://travel-roamradar.<you>.workers.dev`) in **Safari**
   — this must be Safari, not Chrome, on iOS.
2. Tap the **Share** button (the square with an arrow pointing up).
3. Scroll down and tap **Add to Home Screen**.
4. Edit the name if you like → tap **Add** (top right).
5. Open it from the new icon. Log in once; it stays signed in for 30 days.

### Android (Chrome)
1. Open your app URL in **Chrome**.
2. Tap the **⋮** menu (top right).
3. Tap **Add to Home screen** (or **Install app** if it's offered).
4. Confirm **Add / Install**.
5. Open it from the new icon and log in.

> **Tip:** add it on every device you use — each one stays signed in on its own,
> and they all sync through your Worker.

<details>
<summary>Prefer the command line? (optional)</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/giovannibrees/travel-roamradar && cd travel-roamradar
npm i -g wrangler && wrangler login
wrangler kv namespace create TRIPS      # paste the id into wrangler.toml
wrangler deploy
```
</details>

## Automatic import (optional)

The app is fully usable by hand. To make trips fill themselves in, connect these
**from inside the app** (Settings) — no Cloudflare dashboard needed:

- **Google Calendar & Gmail** — one-time setup at console.cloud.google.com
  (create a project, enable the Calendar + Gmail APIs, make an OAuth client;
  the app shows YOUR exact origin/redirect values to paste). Then Settings →
  **Connect Google**. Trips get written to your calendar, and bookings on your
  calendar attach to trips.
- **Email → trip parsing (via Claude)** — paste your own Anthropic API key in
  Settings. Booking confirmations in your inbox (Booking.com, Airbnb, airlines,
  Uber…) are parsed into plans automatically — hotel with door PIN, flight with
  number and times, transfer pickup info. An **hourly background check** files
  new mail even with the app closed; the daily sync does the full run.
- **Forward anything**: send any confirmation email to yourself with **+trip**
  before the @ (e.g. `you+trip@yourdomain.com`) and it's filed within the hour —
  whatever the sender. No matching trip yet? A forwarded **hotel stay or return
  ticket creates the trip automatically**. Filing is geography-aware (a Funchal
  hotel lands in your "Madeira" trip), and even a date-less hotel message (a
  door code, say) files into the right trip by destination. The in-app **Help**
  shows your personal forward address.
- **Calendly** is supported as a Worker secret (see `docs/dev.vars.example`).

Prefer dashboard secrets over in-app keys? Every credential can also be set via
`wrangler secret put` — a dashboard secret always wins over the in-app copy.

## How it works

- `travel-app.html` / `public/index.html` — the front end (one file, vanilla JS).
- `worker.js` — the Cloudflare Worker: serves the app, gates it behind your
  password, runs the optional Google Calendar + Gmail import, and stores
  everything in one KV namespace (`TRIPS`).
- `wrangler.toml` — Worker config: the KV binding, one full sync per day
  (18:00 UTC) and an hourly email-only check — the app's **Sync** button runs
  the full job on demand.

```
Trip: { id, from, to, start (YYYY-MM-DD), end, label, notes, segments[] }
```

## Privacy

Everything lives in **your** Cloudflare account: your trips in your KV, your keys
on your Worker, behind your password. The maintainer of this repo has no
access to your instance or your data.

### Anonymous install count

The one exception, and it's a narrow one: on first-time setup (the moment you
create your password), your instance can send **one** anonymous ping —
literally `{ "id": "<a random 128-bit number>" }` and nothing else — to a
tiny counter Worker the maintainer runs, just so they know roughly how many
people are using this template.

That's the whole of it. **No trip, no email, no key, no name, no location —
no data of any kind beyond that one random number — is ever sent, tracked,
logged, or available to anyone, at any time, for any reason.** The id can't
be traced back to you; it exists only so your instance isn't counted twice.
To see the running total, open `https://<your-counter>.workers.dev/count?key=<your READ_KEY>`
in a browser — it's a plain page with just the number, nothing to parse.
The code for both sides is public: the ping is `pingInstallCount()` in
`worker.js`, and the counter that receives it is the whole of
`counter/counter-worker.js` — five lines that store an id and a total,
nothing more.

It is **off by default** — `TELEMETRY_URL` ships blank in `wrangler.toml`,
which means zero network calls, full stop, unless you deploy the counter
yourself and paste its URL in. Deploying from a public clone of this repo
where someone (e.g. the maintainer) already filled that line in means your
instance participates too; blank the line, or delete the one `ctx.waitUntil
(pingInstallCount(env))` call in `worker.js`, to opt out completely — nothing
else in the app depends on it either way.

## Frequently asked questions

**Is RoamRadar free?**
Yes. It is open-source and self-hosted - you run your own copy on your own
Cloudflare account, which is free for personal use.

**Where is my travel data stored?**
In your own Cloudflare KV, behind your own password. Nothing is sent to a shared
server, and the repo author cannot see your trips.

**Do I have to connect my email or calendar?**
No. RoamRadar is fully usable by hand. Connecting Google Calendar and Gmail is
optional and only makes trips fill themselves in from your existing bookings.

**What is RoamRadar built with?**
A single Cloudflare Worker serving a vanilla-JavaScript front end, with one KV
namespace for storage. No framework, no build step.

**Does RoamRadar support multiple languages?**
Yes! RoamRadar provides full bilingual support for **繁體中文 (Traditional Chinese)** and **English**, easily switchable with one tap directly from the navigation bar or Settings.

**Who made RoamRadar?**
[Giovanni Brees](https://www.giovannibrees.com), a founder and AI-first
entrepreneur. His AI development agent built the app from scratch, with Claude
Fable and Codex reviewing the code and Claude handling the visual design.
